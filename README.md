## Appendix
The following questions were raised to get insights from the dataset:

Question 1: Which hemisphere has more ocurrences?
Question 2: Which hemisphere has more fatalities?
Question 3: Which activity has more fatalities?
Question 3: How Many ocurrences happens in Western Boundary Current areas?

The following information was collected from the processed data:

Northern Hemisphere has more occurrences (N-2338 S-2163);
More fatal incidents occurred in the southern hemisphere (68%);

The activity most recorded during the occurrences was surfing, but the most fatal was swimming with 24% of fatal cases, on the other hand surfing did not account for any occurrence;

Most incidents are not fatal, accounting for 75% of occurrences;

The western boundary current covers more areas in the northern hemisphere (1448), where most occurrences occur, than in the southern hemisphere (1354);

62% of occurrences occur in areas where western boundary currents are found;
